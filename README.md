# Employee Trackers 
  
  ## Description

This application allows employers to add departments, roles, and employees to a database. Additionally, it provides functionality to view and update all of this data. The goal of this application was to practice working with MySQL and the mysql2 package. The biggest challenge encountered was dealing with the asynchronous nature of inquirer and mysql2.
